Flavor: Extra sus with a side of cafeteria pizza

1) If someone vents near MedBay, pretend you didn't see it until the meeting.
2) The reactor is fine. Probably. Do not lick it to check.
3) Pink keeps saying "trust me" — statistically incorrect 87% of the time.
4) If you find a USB drive labeled "Totally Not The Impostor", DO NOT INSERT.
5) Upload your alibi logs early. Late uploads are automatically sus.
6) Task list: swipe card, water plants, tell the AI it’s doing great.

Thank you for flying with Suspicious Airlines. Please keep your hands, feet,
and alibis inside the drop pod at all times.
