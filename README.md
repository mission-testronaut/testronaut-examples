# 🧑‍🚀 Testronaut Mission Suite — Crew Simulation

This repository contains a collection of **example missions** for [Testronaut](https://testronaut.app), designed to run against the demo sandbox at [https://demo.testronaut.app](https://demo.testronaut.app).

Each mission demonstrates how autonomous testing agents can reason, interact, and validate UI workflows in a real browser.

## 🚀 How to Run Missions

1. **Install Testronaut CLI**

```bash
npm install -g testronaut
npx testronaut --init
```

2. **Clone this repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/testronaut-crew-simulation-missions.git
cd testronaut-crew-simulation-missions
```

3. **Set your environment variables** (used by missions)

```bash
export URL="https://demo.testronaut.app"
export USERNAME="Nova"
export PASSWORD="1234"

# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Or for Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

4. **Run a mission**

```bash
npx testronaut login.mission.js
```

5. **Run the full suite**

```bash
npx testronaut
```

## 🧠 Example Mission

```js
import { runMissions } from 'testronaut';

export const loginMission = `
Visit ${process.env.URL}.
Fill in the username field with ${process.env.USERNAME} and password field with ${process.env.PASSWORD}.
Take a screenshot.
Then click the button most likely to login the user.
After clicking "Dock at Mission Control":
  • Wait for either URL to change away from /login or for the login form to disappear.
  • Wait for the mission dashboard to appear.
  • Confirm success if the "Mission Tasks" heading or progress bar appears.
  • Consider failure if a visible alert says "incorrect" or "invalid".
Take a screenshot.
Report SUCCESS or FAILURE with reasoning.
`;

export async function executeMission() {
  return await runMissions({ mission: loginMission }, "login mission");
}
```
